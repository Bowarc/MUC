Multi User Container

Simple server accesible with clients (non web)

The goal of this server is to be able to securely store files on a remote machine with a multi account system

# THIS IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT USE ANY SECURITY SYSTEM

## Features 
- [x] Accounts
- [ ] GUI
- [x] File system on server's machine

I'll make a simple one at first, WITHOUT ANY SECURITY, we'll see later
